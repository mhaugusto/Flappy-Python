Flappy Python

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using Pygame. The objective of the game is to control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes without colliding with them.

Game Logic:

The player controls the bird by pressing the spacebar to make it flap its wings and ascend.
Gravity is applied to the bird, causing it to descend naturally if no input is given.
The game ends if the bird collides with the ground or any of the pipes.
Pipes are generated with a gap in between, and they move from right to left.
The player earns points for successfully passing through each pair of pipes.
The game displays the player's score on the screen.
The player can restart the game by pressing the "R" key after a game over.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x;
Pygame.
How to Run:

Ensure that Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the source code files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command python FlappyBolinha.py to start the game.
Controls:
